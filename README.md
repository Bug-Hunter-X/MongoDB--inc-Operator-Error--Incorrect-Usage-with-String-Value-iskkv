This example demonstrates an uncommon error in MongoDB related to the `$inc` operator.  The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numerical field in a document.  However, if you attempt to increment a field that does not exist or contains a non-numeric value (e.g., a string), MongoDB will throw an error. The solution provides the correct way to use `$inc` and handle potential errors.
